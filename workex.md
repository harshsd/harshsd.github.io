In my short stint of industrial experience, I've had the opportunity to work as a research intern, teaching assistant as well as a team lead of a student body. After being an intern at SINAPSE laboratory at the National University of Singapore, I started my industrial journey as a research intern at Adobe Research, India which motivated me to then take on multiple research projects in NLP and Speech Recognition. During my duties as a teaching assistant and ISMP mentor, I got the chance to mentor students from different disciplines and walks of life. Finally, my experience as the team lead of Mars Rover Team IITB, helped understand the true power of dedication and teamwork and the wonders it can achieve.
