Hi, my name is Harsh Deshpande and I am a final year undergraduate student at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) where I am pursuing a [Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech)](http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/dualdegree.jsp) in Electrical Engineering specialising in Communication and Signal Processing. I have also completed my minor in Computer Science and Engineering.


### Research Interests

My Research Interest include Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning including [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), [Voice Conversion](https://paperswithcode.com/task/voice-conversion) and [Multi-Armed Bandits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit).

Currently, for my M.Tech Thesis, I am working with [Professor Sharayu Moharir](https://sites.google.com/site/sharayumoharir/) on a multi-armed bandit problem where we try and model different modulation schemes as bandit arms with heterogenous data-rates and have proposed policies along with theoretical bounds on their performance.

I am also a part of the [CSALT](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/csalt/) lab at IIT Bombay where I work with [Professor Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/). Currently, I am working on a voice-conversion project which leverages a large amount of clean data available in a domain to perform accent transfer along with noise removal on speech utterances from a smaller and noisy domain.

I am the team-lead of the [IIT Bombay Mars Rover Team](https://iitbmartian.github.io/). At IITB-MRT, I am responsible for leading a team of 35 volunteers who aim to build a prototype Mars rover capable of extra-terrestrial robotics. We recently stood 4th in the IRDC challenge that took place in June 2020 where more than 25 teams from 6+ countries participated.
